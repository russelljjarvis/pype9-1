These models were written in NEURON.  Sample use: Download and expand
the archive (zip) file. cd to the directory and run mknrndll (nrnivmodl
on unix).  Then start up the simulation with
nrngui mosinit.hoc

You should see the recreation of graphs that are similar to the model curves
in figure 6 of paper 1 above.  If you want to see a more exact recreation
change the time step to 0.025 (a larger time step of in some cases
1 ms is used in the default.ses file so that it does not take a long time
to reproduce the families of voltage clamp traces).
