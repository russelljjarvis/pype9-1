Name: parrot_neuron - Neuron that repeats incoming spikes.

Description:

  The parrot neuron simply emits one spike for every incoming spike.
  One possible application for this is to create different channels
  for the output of generator devices such as the poisson_generator
  or the mip_generator.

Remarks:

  Network-wise the parrot neuron behaves like other neuron models
  regarding connections and communication. While the number of
  outgoing spikes equals that of incoming ones, the weigth of the 
  outgoing spikes solely depends on the weigth of outgoing connections.

  A Poisson generator that would send multiple spikes during a single
  time step due to a high rate will send single spikes with 
  multiple synaptic strength instead, for effiacy reasons.
  This can be realized because of the way devices are implemented
  in the threaded environment. A parrot neuron on the other 
  hand always emits single spikes. Hence, in a situation where for 
  example a poisson generator with a high firing rate is connected
  to a parrot neuron, the communication cost associated with outgoing
  spikes is much bigger for the latter.

Receives: SpikeEvent
  
Sends: SpikeEvent
  
Parameters: 

  No parameters to be set in the status dictionary.
