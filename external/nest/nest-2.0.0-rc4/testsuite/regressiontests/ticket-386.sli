Name: testsuite::ticket-386 - ensure all models supporting multimeter work at minimal interval

Synopsis: (ticket-386.sli) run -> dies if test code crashes

Description:
Due to wrong use of calibrate(), recording from ht_neuron with multimeter
with interval equal to resolution crashed. This test briefly simulates
nets with each model supporting multimeter recorded at interval equal to
resolution.
