   Name: testsuite::test_node_distribution - sli script to test the distribution of nodes.

   Synopsis: (test_node_distribution) run -> compare response with reference data

   Description: test_node_distribution checks the spike interaction of several 
   iaf_neuron model neurons, which are grouped in subnets. The output of this script 
   should be the same with all combinations of threads and processes. The order of 
   the lines may vary, however.

   The neurons are connected in an all-to-all fashion and the spikes of the first
   neuron of each subnet are fed into a spike_detector. The nodes of the second
   subnet are forced to be created on the same virtual process.
