Name: testsuite::test_random_custom - test custom random number distributions

Synopsis: (test_random_custom.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
/normal_clipped is an example of a random number distribution defined on
the SLI level. Here we test whether the distribution can be connected to
a random number generator, it can be parameterized, and the range of 
the resulting random numbers is correct.
