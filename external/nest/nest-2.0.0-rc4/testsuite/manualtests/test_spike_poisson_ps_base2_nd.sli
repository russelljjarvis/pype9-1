/* Testscript 

The difference in spike times is exactly 0.0 between 
all resolutions. 
 test_spike_poisson_ps_precision.sli
already verified that spikes are produced and recorded with
double resolution.
  
It is not easy to understand why this script gives identical
results if the computation time step is not representable as 
a double. However, HEP seems to be able to provide a proof.

If this test fails go back to
 test_spike_poisson_ps_precision.sli
to check whether poisson_generator_ps can emit spike times at
double precision or whether spike times are limited to the 
precision of a tic.
