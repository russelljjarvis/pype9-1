 /* BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_hh_psc_alpha - sli script for hh_psc_alpha model

Synopsis: (test_hh_psc_alpha) run -> 'rates.txt'


Description:

  test_hh_psc_alpha produces a rate-response (FI) curve of the Hogkin-Huxley
  neuron  in response to a range of different current (DC) stimulations.
  The result is stored in an extra file, rates.txt, and can be plotted,
  e.g. in matlab using
  x=load('hh_rates.txt'); plot(x(:,1),x(:,2))
  or
  plot "hh_rates.txt" with lines;
  in gnuplot
  
  Since a DC input affetcs only the neuron's channel dynamics, this routine
  does not yet check correctness of synaptic response.
