This directory contains the source code of PyNEST, the Python bindings
to the NEST kernel. A detailed explanation of PyNEST can be found in

PyNEST will be compiled by default. If you want to disable it, use

    --without-python  

as argument for configure. By default, make install will install
PyNEST to /usr/lib/python$PYTHON_VERSION/site-packages/nest. To use a
different installation path use

    --with-pynest-prefix=$prefix

To make the PyNEST module available to the Python interpreter, set the
PYTHONPATH environment variable to

    $prefix/lib/python$PYTHON_VERSION/site-packages/

For help on a NEST objects OBJ in PyNEST, type nest.help(OBJ). To find
out more about NEST, type nest.helpdesk().
