  /**
     Class to handle simulation time and realtime.
     Main idea:
     
     All times given in multiples of "tics":
     A "tic" is a microsecond by default, but may be changed through
     the option --with-tics_per_ms to configure.

     User access to time only through accessor functions:
     - Times can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by ints
     - All real world time is given in ms as double
     - All computation is done based on tics
     
     Three time variables are kept:
     #- time in tics
     #- time in ms
     #- time in steps 

     The largest representable time is available through Time::max().

     @NOTE 
     - The time base (tics per millisecond) can only be set at 
       compile time and by the TimeModifier class.
     - Times in ms are rounded up to the next tic interval.
       This ensures that the time intervals (0, h] are open at the left
       point and closed at the right point. It also ensures compatibility with
       precise timing, namely that the offset u fulfills -h > u >= 0.
     - The resolution (tics per step) can only be set before the first
       node is created and before the simulation starts. The resolution
       can be changed after the network has been deleted and the time
       reset.
     - Implementers of models or methods containing persistent (member variable)
       Time objects, must ensure that these are recalibrated before the
       simulation starts. This is necessary to ensure that step values
       are updated after a change in resolution.
     - The default resolution can be changed using the --with-tics_per_step 
       option to configure.

     
     @NOTE
     The step-time counter is NOT changed when the resolution is
     changed.  This is of no consequence, since changes in resolution
     are permitted at t=0 only.
     
     @NOTE
     - Neurons update themselves in min-delay intervals. During such a min-delay 
       update step, time is in a sense undefined, since it is up to the model how
       it takes its dynamics across the interval. Any spikes emitted and voltage
       information returned must be fixed to time grid points.
     - One may later consider to introduce per-tread simulation time variables.

     @NOTE 
     Is this entire setup still compatible with different step
     lengths in different subnets, or have we abandoned that idea?
     
     @NOTE 
     Delays must be added to current time, and moduloed each time a
     spike is inserted into a ring buffer.  That operation must be
     very fast, and there is no time for conversions.  Thus, delays
     must be stored in steps.  Given the large number of delays in a
     system, we cannot use class Time with its three member variables
     to store delays.  Delays must thus be stored explicitly as long_t
     steps.  Thus, every time the resolution changes, one needs to
     recalculate all delays, and resize all ring buffers. On each Time object,
     Time::calibrate() must be called.

          In this case, only steps need to be recomputed.
       2. The time is outside the limits for the new resolution. 
          In this case, the time is set to the proper infinity.
       3. The time is within the limits of the new resolution, but
          was outside the limits of the old resolution. In this case,
          the actual time value is meaningless (old infinity representation).
          The time is thus set to the infinity with the correct sign.
