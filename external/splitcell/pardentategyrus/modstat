Santhakumar V, Aradi I, Soltesz I (2005) Role of mossy fiber sprouting
and mossy cell loss in hyperexcitability: a network model of the dentate
gyrus incorporating cell types and axonal topography. /J Neurophysiol/ *93*:437-53

Note: a diagram of the model is one of the figures of the paper.
I cannot say at the moment how many states the model has because some
mod files cannot be used with
the variable time step method.
