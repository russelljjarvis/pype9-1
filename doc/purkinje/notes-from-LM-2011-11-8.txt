- How many synapses to activate a Purkinje spike?
  - ~50 synapses in reality
  - Erik suggests ~10 synapses in model for good trade off between importance of synchrony and biological levels
   (THOUGHT: Maybe look at ways to get a single synapse to simulate the firing of several smaller ones by adding noise)

- How large does the EPSP need to be then?
  - Erik reckons ~5 times larger than reality
  - Need to check how large the normal EPSP actually is
  
- How many parallel fibres to synapse with a single Purkinje
  - Around 1000 parallel fibres
  - Remove leaf sections and place synapses on segments instead (need some way of calculating the number of segments 
    and spreading the synapses over the branches
  
- Testing  
  - 1000 synapses, 1hz Poisson spikes
  - Does it look physiologically realistic at soma (need to define what is realistic)
  - Is the dendritic depolarization below a 10-15mv max above, which it may significantly effect the conduction
  
- Tuning  
  - Max conductance and diameter
  - Capacitance??? (on the backburner for now)
  - Length?? (hasn't been brought up yet)
  
- Futher reading
 - Read up on the computational modelling techniques, so understand limitations
 - Read up on effect of capacitance/diameter (probably same as above)  
 
 
 - Membrane too leaky
  - check input resistance with Roth Hausser
  -
