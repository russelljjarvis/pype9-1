Overview
========

"PYthon PipelinEs for 9ml (Pype9)" is a collection of software Python pipelines
to simulate networks of neuron models described in NineML_ using either
Neuron_ or NEST_ simulator backends.

For example, given a cell model described in 9ML saved in
``my_hodgkin_huxley.xml``, the simulator pipeline can run from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pype9 simulate my_hodgkin_huxley.xml#hh_props neuron 100.0 0.01 \
     --play isyn isyn.neo.pkl --record v v.neo.pkl --init_value v -65.0 mV
   
or in a Python script

.. code-block:: python

   from pype9.simulator.neuron import cell, Simulation
   from nineml import units as un
   
   HodgkinHuxley = cell.MetaClass('my_hodgkin_huxley.xml#hh_class')
   with Simulation(dt=0.01 * un.ms, seed=1234) as sim: 
      hh = HodgkinHuxley('my_hodgkin_huxley.xml#hh_props', v=-65.0 * un.mV)
      hh.record('v')
      sim.run(100.0 * un.ms)
   v = hh.recording('v')
   
Pype9 also supports network models described in 9ML via integration with PyNN_

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pype9 simulate brunel.xml nest 1000.0 0.01 \
     --record Exc.spike_output Exc-nest.neo.pkl \
     --record Inh.spike_output Inh-nest.neo.pkl \
     --seed 12345
   
or

.. code-block:: python

   from pype9.simulator.neuron import Network, Simulation
   from nineml import units as un
   
   with Simulation(dt=0.01 * un.ms, seed=1234) as sim: 
      brunel_ai = Network('brunel.xml#AI')
      brunel_ai.component_array('Exc').record('spike_output')
      brunel_ai.component_array('Inh').record('spike_output')
      sim.run(1000.0 * un.ms)
   exc_spikes = brunel_ai.component_array('Exc').recording('spike_output')
   inh_spikes = brunel_ai.component_array('Inh').recording('spike_output')
   
See `Creating Simulations in Python`_ in the Pype9 docs for more examples and pipelines.

In addition to the ``simulate`` command there is also a ``plot`` command for
conveniently plotting the results of the simulation with [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
and a ``convert`` command to convert 9ML files between different serialization
formats (XML, YAML, JSON and HDF5) and 9ML versions (1.0 and 2.0dev). See the
documentation for details.


Documentation
=============
The full Pype9 documentation can be viewed at http://pype9.readthedocs.io/latest.


Installation
============

Pype9 works with either or both of the following simulator backends

* Neuron_ >= 7.3
* NEST_ == 2.10.0

Note that NEST_ 2.12 is not currently supported (due to its module build system changing from
*autotools* to *cmake*). A new Pype9 release will be made to support 2.12.

Detailed instructions on how to install these simulators on different platforms
can be found in the docs.

*After* installing the simulator(s) you plan to use and ensuring that the
commands ``nrnivmodl`` (for Neuron_) and ``nest-config`` (for NEST_) should
be on your system path (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), Pype9
and its prerequisite Python packages can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd <pype9-repo-dir>
   pip install -r requirements.txt .


Unsupported 9ML
===============

9ML aims to be a comprehensive description language for neural simulation. This
means that it allows the expression of some uncommon configurations that are
difficult to implement in Neuron_ and NEST_. Work is planned to make the NEURON
and NEST pipelines in Pype9 support NineML_ fully, however until then the following
restrictions apply to models that can be used with Pype9.

* synapses must be linear (to be relaxed in v0.2)
* synapses can only have one variable that varies over a projection (e.g.
  weight) (to be relaxed in v0.2)
* no analog connections between populations (i.e. gap junctions) (gap
  junctions to be implemented in v0.2)
* only one event send port per cell (current limitation of Neuron_/NEST_)
* names given to 9ML elements are not escaped and therefore can clash with
  built-in keywords and some PyPe9 method names (e.g. 'lambda' is a reserved
  keyword in Python). Please avoid using names that clash with C++ or Python
  keywords (all 9ML names will be escaped in PyPe9 v0.2).


Reporting Issues
================

Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the GitHub issue tracker
(http://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyPe9/issues).
